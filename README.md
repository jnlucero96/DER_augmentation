"A Microgrid Deployment Framework to Support Drayage Electrification"

The electrification of heavy-duty commercial vehicles (HDCVs) is pivotal in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and urban air pollution; however, this transition poses significant challenges for the existing electric grid, which is not designed to meet the high electricity demands of HDCVs. This can lead to a less effective reduction in freight transportationâ€™s carbon intensity despite significant electrification efforts. Deploying renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaics, alongside energy storage solutions, is essential to address these challenges. This paper examines the current grid limitations and explores the critical role of microgrid deployment, integrating solar and battery energy storage systems, in supporting the electrification of HDCVs. We propose an integrated framework that is designed to enhance regional grid capacity and decrease carbon intensity by identifying viable sites where a microgrid can be deployed and provide estimates for the deployment cost. Furthermore, using this framework, we quantify the maximal impact of microgrid deployment in reducing CO2 emissions when we optimize the use of the available power. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to the region of the Port of Savannah, GA USA.
